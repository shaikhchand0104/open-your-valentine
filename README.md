# Open Your Valentine 💝

A single-page romantic surprise you can share as a link. When opened, it asks:

> **Muskan, will you be my Valentine?**

- **Yes** → opens a romantic dashboard with hearts + a photo gallery.
- **No** → the button runs away 😄
- After **30s** → a **Shayari** link appears. When finished → shows the final message.

## Quick Start

Just open `index.html` in your browser locally to preview.

## Add Your Photos

Replace files in `images/` with your 5–6 photos (`photo1.jpg`..`photo6.jpg`). Any missing image shows a cute placeholder.

## Deploy — Netlify (Fastest)

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag & drop the **`open-your-valentine/`** folder.
3. Get your live URL instantly and share it!

OR create a Netlify site from Git:
- Create a new Git repo, push this folder.
- In Netlify, **New site from Git** → connect your repo → deploy. No build needed.

## Deploy — GitHub Pages (Free)

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., `open-your-valentine`).
2. Upload all files (keep `index.html` at the root).
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
4. Under **Build and deployment**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
5. Select `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder → **Save**.
6. Page will publish at `https://<your-username>.github.io/open-your-valentine/`.

## Personalize
- Change the name “Muskan” directly in `index.html` (search the file for it).
- Edit the Shayari lines in the `<script>` `lines` array.
- Colors are set at the top of the `<style>` block.
